# Sales Forecasting for Retail

## Objective
To predict future sales for a retail business to optimize inventory management and make informed business decisions. This project implements an end-to-end data science pipeline including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model training with walk-forward validation, model comparison, and sales forecasting.

## Tech Stack
*   Python 3.x
*   Pandas
*   NumPy
*   Scikit-learn
*   Statsmodels
*   Prophet (by Facebook)
*   Matplotlib
*   Seaborn

## Dataset
*   **Source**: Customer Shopping Trends Dataset by Mohit Bhadaria on Kaggle.
*   **URL**: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhadramohit/customer-shopping-latest-trends-dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhadramohit/customer-shopping-latest-trends-dataset)
*   **Note**: The dataset CSV file (`shopping_trends.csv`) is not included in this repository. It must be downloaded from the Kaggle link above and placed in the `sales_forecasting_retail/data/` directory before running the project.

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or create the structure manually).**
2.  **Create a Python virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    Create a `requirements.txt` file with the following content:
    ```txt
    pandas
    numpy
    scikit-learn
    statsmodels
    prophet
    matplotlib
    seaborn
    ```
    Then run:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Download the dataset:**
    Download `shopping_trends.csv` from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhadramohit/customer-shopping-latest-trends-dataset) and place it in the `sales_forecasting_retail/data/` directory.

## How to Run the Project
Once the setup is complete and the dataset is in place, run the main pipeline script from the `sales_forecasting_retail` directory:
```bash
python scripts/main.py
```
This will execute all steps: data preprocessing, EDA, model training, selection, and forecasting. Outputs will be saved in the `sales_forecasting_retail/reports/` directory.

## Summary of Findings (Template)
*(This section should be updated after running the pipeline and analyzing the results.)*

*   **EDA Insights**: Briefly describe key findings from EDA (e.g., trends, seasonality observed).
*   **Model Performance**: Summarize the performance of different models. Which model performed best based on MAE/RMSE/MAPE?
*   **Forecasts**: Briefly describe the nature of the generated forecasts.

## Potential Future Enhancements
*   Hyperparameter tuning for all models (e.g., using grid search or Bayesian optimization).
*   Inclusion of more sophisticated models (e.g., LSTMs, other deep learning models for time series).
*   Incorporating exogenous variables more formally into models like ARIMAX if relevant signals are present.
*   More robust error handling and logging.
*   Creation of a configuration file for parameters like forecast horizon, model orders, etc.
*   Building a simple API or dashboard to serve the forecasts.
